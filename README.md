## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the importance of thoroughly analyzing the Figma design before starting to code. Not spending enough time understanding the layout and planning my code structure led to wasted time and unnecessary rework. Careful preparation makes the development process much smoother.

## Responsive design

The site is responsive, with layouts for mobile and tablet devices at the following breakpoints:

```css
/* SMALL DESKTOP */

@media (max-width: 1170px) {
}

/* TABLET */

@media (max-width: 768px) {
}

/* MOBILE */

@media (max-width: 375px) {
}
```
